# Ask the user for their name and their guess
name = input("What is your name? : ")
print("Hi " + name)
print("Enter a number between: ", minGuess, "and", maxGuess)
guess = int(input("What is your guess? : "))

# Generate a random number and tell the user if they won or lost
secretNumber = random.randint(minGuess, maxGuess)
if guess == secretNumber:
    print("Congratulation, you got it right!")
else:
    print("You lose - the number was ", secretNumber)

    print("Thank you for playing Guess the Number")
